Urban Tag is a Web + Android application allowing to push some geo-localized and timestamped content to people whilst they are walking their way in a city.

The Web app is used to create the geo-localized content (made of geo-localized places, optionnaly associated with timestamped events).

The Android app is mainly a "passive" app receiving the geo-localized content (using push notifications) as soon as the user's geo-location is close to the location of a place.
The Android app can also be used to search for already received content (by using a map, or specifying a set of tags).

Urban Tag leverages Capptain's unique geo-fencing and real-time capabilities, and so Urban Tag uses Capptain platform's APIs (mainlky the Reach API).
